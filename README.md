# Shapewars
An RPG game in which avatars are based off of shapes that you create.
You will choose a class that best fits your fighting style eg: range, melee, mage, ect.
By using items, weapons and armor (found or bought) will help aid the long journey.
Solving puzzels and getting through obstacles are not the only challeges, as there will
be many enemies and bosses you need to defeat to level yourself higher and unlock new abilities.
